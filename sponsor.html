        <h3><span>Why sponsor?</span></h3>
        <p class="intro">
          We connect you to the next generation of developers, thinkers and entrepreneurs.
        </p>
        <p>
          Sponsoring UNIHACK is a great way to connect with the top IT students from the the University of Melbourne,
          Monash University, the University of Sydney, the UNSW, RMIT and other universities across Australia. Similar
          hackathons in the United States and Europe have provided sponsors access to many talented students who
          end up working for them in the future.
        </p>
        <p>This is the best time to sponsor UNIHACK - here’s exactly why:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Meet talented students:</strong> Get access and establish personal relationships with some of the
            most driven and talented computer science, design, electrical and software engineering
            students from some of Australia’s top universities – before anyone else.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Witness these students perform</strong> during ideation, planning, building and presentation of
            their solutions. We provide a real environment for teamwork and execution, outside of the
            classroom or assessment centre setting.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Real-time adoption of products and feedback:</strong>  This is the time when students will be able to
            try your product. They’ll be hacking away, trying new things and experimenting on how to
            bring your API/hardware to be used to the next level in ways you’ve not thought of before.
            You can also provide feedback and support as a mentor with their ideas and pitch.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Brand recognition and exposure:</strong> Show off your company’s technical side through various
            means – such as social media promotion, tech workshops, and API/hardware demos.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Promote your organisation’s graduate and internship programs</strong>  through our social media
            channels and Careers Fair.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Say that you supported UNIHACK</strong>, an event that is promoting innovation in Australia.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          The organisers of UNIHACK are committed in increasing the diversity of UNIHACK competitors. We
          will be collaborating with Women in ICT and Engineering groups across Australia to help promote
          the event. We will also collaborate with ICT and Engineering groups that represent LGBT students
          to ensure they are also represented at UNIHACK.
        </p>
        <p>
          We are also committed in producing a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of
          gender, age, sexual orientation, disability and religion. All persons involved in UNIHACK are
          required to comply with the terms set out in the Hack Code of Conduct this year &mdash; including
          attendees, sponsors, partners, volunteers and staff.
